# Drug vs. Disease

Drug versus Disease (DvD) provides a pipeline, available through R or Cytoscape, for the comparison of drug and disease gene expression profiles from public microarray repositories. Dynamic access to both Array Express and GEO is provided, with automatic annotation and generation of differential expression profiles. These profiles can be compared to a reference set of profiles from the Connectivity Map or to a users own set of data. Correlations between profiles are calculated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Resulting matches between drug and disease profiles can be viewed in a network representation within the Cytoscape plug-in. Negatively correlated (enriched) profiles can be used to generate hypotheses of drug-repurposing whilst positively correlated (enriched) profiles may be used to infer side-effects of drugs.

## Installation instructions for R packages

1.  Make sure you have R installed. You can download it from [http://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/](http://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk).

_Note: We recommend use the **2.15** version of R_

2.  For Mac users you will need to have installed the tcltk add-on for R. This can be downloaded from [http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg).

3.  Open R console.

4.  First install the dependencies which are required for the DvD package. [Download](http://www.saezlab.org/files/drugvsdisease/DvDdependencies.R) the R script DvDdependencies.R, this script will automatically check for and if necessary install R packages required by DvD.

```{R}
source("~/DvDdependencies.R") #where "~/" should be the directory where the source file is stored
```

5. To install the DrugVsDiseasedata package. [Download](http://www.saezlab.org/files/drugvsdisease/DrugVsDiseasedata_0.99.2.tar.gz) the source file DrugVsDiseasedata_0.99.2.tar.gz

```{R}
install.packages("~/DrugVsDiseasedata_0.99.2.tar.gz",type="source") #note "~/" should point to the directory where the file is saved
library(DrugVsDiseasedata)
```

6. To install the cMap2data package. [Download](http://www.saezlab.org/files/drugvsdisease/cMap2data_0.99.1.tar.gz)the source file cMap2data_0.99.1.tar.gz

```{R}
install.packages("~/cMap2data_0.99.1.tar.gz",type="source") #note "~/" should point to the directory where the file is saved
library(cMap2data) 
```

7.  Finally [download](http://www.saezlab.org/files/drugvsdisease/DrugVsDisease_1.1.2.tar.gz) and install the DrugVsDisease package (DrugVsDisease_1.1.2.tar.gz)

```{R}
install.packages("~/DrugVsDisease_1.1.2.tar.gz",type="source") #note "~/" should point to the directory where the file is saved
library(DrugVsDisease)
```

## Installation instructions for Cytoscape plug-in

1.  Make sure you have installed DvD, DvDdata and dependencies as above. Install Rserve. It is a R package that enables communication between Java and R. Enter the following commands in R console:  
```{R}
    install.packages("Rserve") # This command only needs to be typed once
    library(Rserve)
    Rserve(args="--vanilla")
```

_Note: Rserve is only disabled if you restart your pc. Thus, if you want to use Rserve after reboot you have to call it again._  
_On Windows Rserve may also stop working if an error is encountered._  

2.  Make sure you have Cytoscape installed. You can download it from [http://www.cytoscape.org/download.html](http://www.cytoscape.org/download.html).

_Note: We recommend use the **2.8.3** version of Cytoscape_

3.  Install DvD plugin.
    1.  Download DvD plug-in jar file [here](http://www.saezlab.org/files/drugvsdisease/dvd.jar).
    2.  In Cytoscape go to _'Plugins' -> 'Install Plugin from File'_
    3.  Search for _DvD_ jar file.
    4.  DvD is now installed.
    
_IMPORTANT: Before using DvD on Ubuntu you need to type on Terminal_

 ```
 sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev 	
 sudo apt-get install libxt-dev
 ```
